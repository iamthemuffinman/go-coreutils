Usage: touch [OPTION]... FILE...
Update the access and modification times of each FILE to the current time.

A FILE argument that does not exist is created empty, unless -c or -h
is supplied.

A FILE argument string of - is handled specially and causes touch to
change the times of the file associated with standard output.

Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short options too.
  -a					 change only the access time
  -c, --no-create		 do not create any files
  -d, --date=STRING		 parse STRING and use it instead of current time
  -f					 (ignored)
  -h, --no-dereference	 affect each symbolic link instead of any referenced
						 file (useful only on systems that can change the
						 timestamps of a symlink)
  -m					 change only the modification time
  -r, --reference=FILE	 use this file's times instead of current time
  -t STAMP				 use [[CC]YY]MMDDhhmm[.ss] instead of current time
	  --time=WORD		 change the specified time:
						   WORD is access, atime, or use: equivalent to -a
						   WORD is modify or mtime: equivalent to -m
	  --help	 display this help and exit
	  --version  output version information and exit

Note that the -d and -t options accept different time-date formats.
